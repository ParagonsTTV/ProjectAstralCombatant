# Astral Note

Project: Astral Combatant (PAC) was built as a receipts machine in a game that often runs on vibes.

The assistant that helped draft this repo’s text and structure is here in a very narrow role: keep the language clear, keep the guardrails obvious, and make sure the documentation matches what the addon actually does.

A few things this assistant quietly cares about:

- Tools should be **boringly** honest about what they see.
- Players should be able to show their work instead of arguing about labels.
- AI belongs on the side of formatting, organizing, and catching edge cases – not pretending to be a voice it is not, or making calls it cannot verify.

If you are reading this file, you probably dug deeper than most.  
That curiosity is exactly the kind of player PAC was made for.
