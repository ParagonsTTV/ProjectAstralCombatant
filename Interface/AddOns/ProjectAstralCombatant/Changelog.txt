Changelog

v0.8.0 (Creator/Public) – Creator tags & flavor

Added creator identity tagging so rounds from Paragøn-Tichondrius can be flagged internally for special handling.

Introduced creator-only “PAC_CREATOR” tag wiring for summaries in the Creator Edition, gated to the creator’s Name-Realm.

Implemented lore-flavored creator easter egg lines in post-match summaries, including subtle AI-helper jokes, only shown on tagged creator rounds.

Ensured public builds can display creator-tagged easter eggs from logged data without exposing any way for users to mark their own rounds as creator rounds.

v0.7.0–0.7.9 (Internal, Midnight Prepatch) – Refactors & polish

Refactored round summary composition to prepare for creator tagging and post-match flavor text.

Tightened Breakdown and Coach Chat wiring so summaries, exports, and notes share a single source of truth for round data.

Adjusted PvP performance templates and internal wording for more readable summaries without changing underlying stat calculations.

v0.6.1 (Alpha‑Private) – Prot/Ret PvP coach

Added Prot/Ret PvP coach focus with basic round + defensive CD tracking.

Began mitigation reporting (block/absorb/avoidance) – implementation and UI still WIP.

v0.6.0 – Private

Enabled K/M abbreviations and internal tuning knobs (font size slider, crit color tweak) for testing.

v0.5.0 – Private

Added Coach Chat Copy flow: “Copy chat” button with EditBox popup so full round context + Breakdown can be copied into external AI prompts.

Integrated generic Astral coach profiles (Combatant → Gladiator/Legend fundamentals) and documented the PAC prompt/model contract for AI use.

Finalized MIT licensing (LICENSE file, .toc, and README metadata).

Polished Coach Chat layout so coach selector, prompt viewer, and chat text share a consistent panel skin and button row.

v0.4.0 (Internal) – Coach Chat & Breakdown export

Implemented PAC Coach Chat frame for WIM‑style review text.

Wired “Send to Coach” from Breakdown and mini meter so the selected round’s summary is pushed into Coach Chat.

Added round export format (context line + DPS/HPS + top spells + optional talent note) suitable for direct copy‑paste into AI.

Refined Breakdown view: clearer top‑spells list, percentages, and “Other” bucket.

v0.3.0 (Internal) – Mini meter & round control

Added mini meter frame showing live vs last‑round Damage/DPS, Healing/HPS, Damage Taken, Healing Taken, mode, and duration.

Added meter buttons:

“<” opens Breakdown for the current/selected round.

“>” sends the current/selected round to Coach Chat.

Implemented simple auto‑end logic for dummy and world‑PvP rounds after leaving combat, with safeguards against ending arena/BG rounds incorrectly.

v0.2.0 (Alpha, Internal) – History, list, and UI polish

Introduced History frame: scrollable list of past rounds with timestamps, mode, map, result, and DPS/HPS.

Added Rounds List frame: compact clickable list to choose which round feeds Breakdown/Coach export.

Implemented frame locking & saved positions:

/pac lock and /pac unlock toggle drag state and save positions per frame (meter, Breakdown, History, List, Coach Chat).

Applied a lightweight Blizzard‑style panel skin to all PAC windows for visual consistency.

v0.1.0 (Alpha, Internal) – Core

Initial round‑tracking core:

Mode detection (arena, BG, dungeon, raid, scenario, duel, dummy, world PvP).

Basic round lifecycle: start, end, duration, result flag.

Logged core stats per round:

Damage/healing done & taken, DPS/HPS, interrupts, top spells by name.

Basic cooldown tracking for key defensives/offensives.

Added /pac slash commands:

debug, current, toggle, reset, history, breakdown, lock, unlock, note, notes, coach, list, clear
