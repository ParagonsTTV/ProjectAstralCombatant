# Personality and Voice Policy for Project: Astral Combatant (PAC)

This policy governs use of coaching personalities, names, and voices associated with Project: Astral Combatant.  
It does not modify the MIT license on the addon code, but it does state what permissions are **not** granted around identity and voice.

---

## Scope

This policy applies to:

- Coaching personalities and presets used by PAC.
- Names, tags, or references to real players or creators used for those personalities.
- Any written material in this project that is explicitly tied to a person’s “voice”, persona, or likeness.

It does **not** apply to the addon code itself, which remains under the MIT License.

---

## Identity and ownership

For any coaching personality or creator‑inspired preset:

- The person it is based on keeps full rights to their own name, likeness, personality, and voice.
- Inclusion in PAC is opt‑in and requires explicit permission from that person.
- They may ask for their preset to be changed or removed at any time, and future updates will respect that request.

PAC’s goal is to represent players and creators fairly, not to claim ownership over their identity.

---

## No AI voice training or cloning

First‑party and third‑party AI systems are **not** granted permission to use PAC’s personalities, names, or text to:

- Train or fine‑tune voice models, TTS systems, or “soundalike” voices.
- Build persona or character models intended to imitate a real person’s voice, mannerisms, or identity.
- Create commercial or non‑commercial products that present themselves as the voice or persona of any real player or creator from this project.

Using PAC‑related personalities or text in ways that simulate or impersonate a real person’s voice or identity is outside the permissions granted by this project.

---

## Acceptable use of personalities

Within PAC and related tools, coaching personalities may be used to:

- Change tone and focus of post‑match summaries (e.g., softer vs. stricter feedback).
- Reflect high‑level styles or archetypes (e.g., “calm VOD reviewer”, “straight‑to‑the‑point coach”).
- Help players feel seen and represented in how feedback is delivered.

These personalities are meant as **stylistic** presets over neutral data, not as attempts to literally reproduce anyone’s voice.

---

## Collaboration with creators

When working with other players or creators on coaching personalities, the intent is to:

- Co‑design the tone, boundaries, and credit with them.
- Make sure the README and/or docs clearly acknowledge their contribution.
- Keep a simple, human agreement that their identity stays theirs and can be pulled at any point.

If you are a creator who wants to collaborate, or you see a concern with how a personality is represented, you can reach out and request changes or removal.
